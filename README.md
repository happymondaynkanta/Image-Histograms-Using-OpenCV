# Image-Histograms-Using-OpenCV
A Histogram is a variation of a bar chart in which data values are grouped together and put into different classes. This grouping allows you see how frequently data in each class occur in the data set. 
A histogram represents the distribution of pixel intensities (whether color or grayscale) in an image. It can be visualized as a graph (or plot) that gives a high-level intuition of the intensity (pixel value) distribution. We are going to assume a RGB color space in this example, so these pixel values will be in the range of 0 to 255.
